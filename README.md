# The purpose of this finite state machine lab is to get accustomed to Verilog coding and the techniques to clearly structure code through states in the Vivado environment. Another purpose is to provide more modular programming practice through instantiation and utilization of many components/modules from previous labs. Then design a test bench utilizing the techniques learned in class for efficiency and better practice, and learn how to display the different modules wires from the top level unexpanded view in the waveform.
